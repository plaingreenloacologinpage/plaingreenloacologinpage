While most states have usury laws that limit interest charges to anywhere between 5% and 30%, payday lenders fall under exemptions that allow them to charge many times that in certain states.

Currently 37 states have laws that permit payday loans, although many put some restrictions on them and some prohibit them altogether.

In California, for example, a payday lender can only lend up to $300 at a time. It can also charge a fee of up to 15% of the loan amount, with a maximum fee total of $45. Although 15% doesn't seem exceptionally high, on a 14-day loan, it becomes the equivalent of an APR of 460% for a $300 loan.

While the federal Truth in Lending Act requires payday lenders to disclose their finance charges, many people apparently overlook the costs in their hurry to get the cash.
