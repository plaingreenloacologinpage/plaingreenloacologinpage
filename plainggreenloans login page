Payday loans go by a number of names in different places around the country, and there is no universally accepted definition for them. But they are typically short-term loans for amounts of $500 or less. In general they must be repaid in full on the borrower's next payday, or when the borrower receives other income they have coming due, such as a Social Security payment. As such, they typically have terms of two to four weeks.

Payday loans are characterized by their high interest rates. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (plainggreenloans login page), "A typical two-week payday loan with a $15 per $100 fee equates to an annual percentage rate (APR) of almost 400 percent.
